### FastAPI
In this Lab, we are going to learn how to use FastAPI framework for building APIs

#### What is FastAPI? 

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

#### Content
- **Usecase 1** - Demonstrates simple API to fetch and create items
    - main.py -> Cotains the basic usage code of API with all the required routing logic
